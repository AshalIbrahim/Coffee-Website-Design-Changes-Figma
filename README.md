Made some changes on the design of this coffee site. Previously, the user had to find the menu button all the way down and had some trouble with it. 
I personally as a first time visiter took some time to find the menu and had to scroll through a long list of items.
I redesigned this in a way in which a user can easily navigate through all of the options easily by selecting the sub category first.
I used a blue underline for cold drinks and a warmer orange color for hot drinks.
